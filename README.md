# 🌿 Paudha Rakshak– Plant Disease Detection Using AI

**Paudha Rakshak** is a responsive web-based application built using **Flask** and **Machine Learning** to detect plant diseases from images. Users can **upload plant leaf images** or **capture photos using the device’s rear camera**. Based on the image, the app detects the disease and provides:

- 🌱 Disease name  
- 💊 Precautionary measures  
- 🌾 Recommended fertilizers and supplements  

Additionally, the platform allows users to **borrow essential gardening items**, such as **fertilizers, supplements, and other plant-care equipment**, making it a complete tool for plant health and management.

## 📸 Features

- Detect plant diseases using a trained ML model
- Upload images or capture using the rear camera
- Get precautions and treatment recommendations
- Borrow plant essentials like fertilizers and supplements
- Clean, responsive design for all screen sizes
- Backend powered by Flask; image processing with Pillow; data lookup with Pandas
